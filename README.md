### Stupid Sequencer

Six lanes of step sequencers - where you have no control over the notes that are
playing...

Row 8 can be used for moving the playhead to a certain point, or for changing
the loop start and end points by double pressing

Row 7 contains random commands
- Column 1 pauses the sequencer
- Column 2 reverses the order notes play in

### Poly Rythmn Drum sequencer
-- TODO make this
